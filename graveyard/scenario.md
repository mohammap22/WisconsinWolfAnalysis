### Describe the Scenario: 
Ever since the late 1990s, the Wisconsin wolf population has been on the rise and currently stands at 972. However, Wisconsin residents, especially the ones in the northern portions of the state, have expressed growing concern about the prevalence of wolves. They argue that these wolves are not only dangerous to the local animal populations, but also to humans. These residents claim that the wolves frequently kill their livestock, have a negative impact the deer population, and are very dangerous towards humans. This report aims to investigate these claims using statical analysis from multiple of sources. Specifically, we will be addressing these three questions:
- How has the growth in the Wisconsin Gray Wolf population impacted the Wisconsin deer population?
- Has the growing wolf population led to an increase in the number of interactions between people and wolves?
- How have the lives and deaths of wolves changed over the reporting period?
