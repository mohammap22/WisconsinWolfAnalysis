# Functional Specification:

## Background:
The goal of this project is to perform a statistical analysis on the impact of the Gray Wolf population in Wisconsin in order to support or refute commonly held concerns about the impacts of Gray Wolves

Questions of Interest:
- How has the growth in the Wisconsin Gray Wolf population impacted the Wisconsin deer population?
- Has the growing wolf population led to an increase in the number of interactions between people and wolves?
- Time permitting, how have the lives and deaths of wolves changed over the reporting period?

- Find the original source of the data we used
- Use our process to scrape the data
- Follow any data cleaning steps we employed
- Rerun the statistical tests we did in our analysis and compare their results
with ours
    * Check that the assumptions we used in our analysis also hold for the data
    in theirs

### 2. A Researcher Expanding Upon Our Work
They will:
- Find the original source of the data we used and the format we worked it into
- Decide whether to use our data source or another
- Use our process to scrape the data from our source, or use a variety of
methods to clean their alternate data source(s) 
- Understand why we selected the statistical tests we did so they can determine
what methods they will use in their work 
- If they decide to run the statistical tests we did, they will rerun the tests
and compare their results with ours
    * Check that the assumptions we used in our analysis also hold for the data
    in theirs


### 3. A Curious Reader Studying Our Report
They will:
- Access to results of our analysis, probably from a link online
- Examine the report to learn how wolves might impact their lives or to learn
about our analysis process
