# How to Install PDF Parser Dependencies

## Introduction
There are a few specific dependies required (based on user OS) to use our PDF Parser. 
The main dependency is a package called Camelot. 
This document will guide the user on how to setup their specific environment. 

## General Dependencies 
User needs to have python 3.0 or greater installed. 
This is so the installation of ghostscript and tkinter goes smoothly.

Run the command:
`sudo apt install ghostscript python3-tk`

This command installs both ghostscript and tkinter. 

## For Mac Users
Run the command:
`sudo brew install ghostscript tcl-tk`

## After Installation
One needs to import tkinter before running anything in camelot. 
In python run the code `import tkinter`
